1 - make a card for a player that shows the photo and their name

2 - put them on the page side-by-side. Simply make it responsive. Use flex if need be.

3 - make the list a horizontally scrollable list. to do this, you can add more players or double up

4 - make a little menu that's going to have the data structure names - LL, BT, BST, etc

5 - Enhance the card with a slideout with a scrollable list of all the stats
